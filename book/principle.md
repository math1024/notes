#### 个人

##### 5.5 综合分析现实、理解如何行动的最好工具是逻辑、理性和常识



#### 组织

##### 9.6j 帮助人们更好应对由挖掘缺点而带来的痛苦

* 首先，让他们看到自己的失败，其清晰程度足以推动他们做出改变；其次，告诉他们，如何改变做事方式，或者依靠擅长自己弱项的人
* First let them see their failures so clearly that they are motivated to change them, and then show them how to either change what they are doing or rely on others who are strong where they are weak.

##### 9.7a 如果一个人工作干得不怎么样，要考虑这是由于学习不够，还是能力不足

* 缺乏经验或训练造成的缺点可以被修正，而能力不足却不可以
* A weakness that is due to a lack of experience or training can be fixed, while a weakness that is due to a lack of ability can’t be

##### 9.8a 对人进行判断时，不必达到“没有一丝疑问”的地步

* 追求完美会浪费时间，阻碍进展
* **Perfect understanding isn’t possible**; trying to get to it wastes time and stalls progress

##### 9.8d 要像评估应聘者一样严格评估员工

* frank and ongoing evaluations are so important.

##### 9.9 培训、设护栏或辞退员工，不要修复

* 鉴于价值观和能力很难改变，修复通常是不切实际的
* Since values and abilities are difficult to change, rehabilitation is typically impractical

##### 9.9a 不要让员工尸位素餐

* 与辞退人或重新委派任务相比，把一个人留在不适合的岗位上才更糟糕
* It is much worse to keep someone in a job unsuitable for them than it is to fire or reassign them.

9.9b 准备好"朝你爱的人开枪"

* love the people you shoot
* Doing this is one of those difficult, necessary things. 困难面必要的事情
* it is necessary for the long-term excellence of the company. 长期卓越

9.11 不要降低标准

* **如果一个人无法在一定时间内达到我们在追求卓越、极度求真、极度透明等方面的高标准，那么就必须离开。**
* if a person cannot operate within our requirements of excellence through radical truth and transparency in an acceptable time frame, he or she must leave.

##### 10 像操作一部机器那样进行管理以实现目标

* 无论你做什么工作，从更高层次的角度看，你就是在设定目标，并建造机器来实现目标
* No matter what work you do, at a high level you are simply setting goals and building machines to help you achieve them
* 不管你设计得有多好，你的机器总会出问题
* No matter how good you are at design, your machine will have problems.

##### 10.1a 不断把结果和你的目标进行对照

* 所有产出都会反映出机器运转情况
* **as all outcomes are reﬂections of how the machine is running**

##### 10.1c 制定量化评价工具

* 量化工具是进行评价的客观途径，并对提高生产率往往有良好功效
* Metrics are an objective means of assessment and they tend to have a favorable impact on productivity
* 制定量化工具时，要考虑到你为了解事物进展而需要回答的最重要的问题，并设想哪些数据可以提供答案。不要将你已有的数据按你的意图去粉饰
* In constructing your metrics, imagine the most important questions you need answered in order to know how things are going and imagine what numbers will give you the answers to them. Don’t look at the numbers that you have and try to adapt them to your purposes
* 要记住，任何一个量化工具都可能给出误导的信息
* Remember that any single metric can mislead; you need enough evidence to establish patterns.

##### 10.1d 要注意别把精力过多用于应付眼前的各种事务，而忽视你的机器

* If you keep your focus on each individual task, you will inevitably get bogged down. If instead you **pay attention to building and managing your machines**, you will be rewarded many times over
* 如果只把注意力放在完成每个单项任务上，你就会不可避免地深陷其中。如果你能**把注意力放在建造和管理机器上**，就会不断有所回报



#### 每日原则 

* 可能会重复

#####  找出一个问题之后不要容忍问题

* Tolerating a problem has the same consequences as failing to identify it
*  You need to develop a ﬁerce intolerance of badness of any kind, regardless of its severity
* 找到问题的真正原因

##### 做一个超级现实的人

* The pursuit of dreams is what gives life its ﬂavor. 
* My point is that people who create great things aren’t idle dreamers: They are totally grounded in reality. Being hyperrealistic will help you choose your dreams wisely and then achieve them.

##### 无论你向谁提问，对方一般都会提供“答案”，所以要仔细考虑要向谁提问

* I regularly see people ask totally uninformed or nonbelievable people questions and get answers that they believe. This is often worse than having no answers at all.

  我经常见到有人向完全不了解情况或缺乏可信度的人提问，并相信对方的回答。与其这样，还不如不提问。

* Don’t make that mistake. You need to think through who the right people are. If you’re in doubt about someone’s believability, ﬁnd out.

  不要犯这样的错误。你需要仔细考虑向哪些人提问。如果你怀疑某人的可信度，要查明。

* The same is true for you: If someone asks you a question, think ﬁrst whether you’re the right person to answer it. If you’re not believable, you probably shouldn’t have an opinion about what they’re asking, let alone share it.

  对你自己也是如此：如果有人问你一个问题，你要首先想想你自己是否合适回答这个问题。如果你觉得自己的可信度不够，或许就不应该对此存在意见，更不要说是将观点分享出去。

* Be sure to direct your comments or questions to the believable Responsible Party or Parties for the issues you want to discuss. Feel free to include others if you think that their input is relevant, while recognizing that the decision will ultimately rest with whoever is responsible for it.

##### 看似善意而不够准确对人是有害的， 对其他人和机构通常也是如此。

* What might seem kind but isn’t accurate is harmful to the person and often to others in the organization as well

#####  准确评价人，不做“好好先生”

* 没人说实事求是很容易。有时候，尤其是对那些还不习惯这样做的新员工， 诚实评价会感觉像是人身攻击。要从更高的层面去看，着眼全局，并建议被评价者也这样做

* Nobody ever said radical honesty was easy. Sometimes, especially with new employees who have not yet gotten used to it, an honest assessment feels like an attack. Rise to a higher level and keep your eye on the bigger picture and counsel the person you are evaluating to do the same.

##### 在抛开等级的情况下就评估达成共识

* 在多数机构中，评估只有一个方向，即管理者评估被管理者。被管理者通常都不认同评估，尤其当结果比其自我评估差的时候， 因为多数人都把自己想得比实际情况更好。被管理者对管理者也会有看法，但在多数公司里他们都不敢直说，所以会产生误解和怨愤。这种不当行为损害了公司的效率以及人际关系。以高质量方式达成共识，就可避免这种情况。你的下属要相信你不是他们的敌人- 你只是想寻求真相、想帮助他们，因此不会让他们自我欺骗、延续自己的谎言，或听之任之。这必须以开诚布公、透明的方式进行，因为如果某人觉得自己没有被公正地对待，这个过程就失去了它的效用。作为平等的伙伴关系，是否寻求真相取决于你们双方。如果各方都是平等的参与者，就不会有人觉得被逼得走投无路。
* In most organizations, evaluations run in only one direction, with the manager assessing the managee. The managee typically disagrees with the assessment, especially if it is worse than his or her self-assessment, because most people believe themselves to be better than they really are. Managees also have opinions about managers that they wouldn’t dare bring up in most companies, so misunderstandings and resentments fester. This perverse behavior undermines the effectiveness of the environment and the relationships between people. It can be avoided by getting in sync in a high-quality way. Your reports have to believe that you’re not their enemy—that your sole goal is to move toward the truth; that you are trying to help them and so will not enable their self-deception, perpetuate a lie, or let them off the hook. This has to be done in an honest and transparent way, because if someone believes they are being pigeonholed unfairly the process won’t work. As equal partners, it is up to both of you to get to the truth. When each party is an equal participant, no one can feel cornered.

* 从长期看，达成共识能提高效率从而节约时间，但很重要的一点是，你需要将它做好。由于时间所限，你需要排定优先顺序，哪些事、需要与谁达成共识。排在最前面的，应当是与最可信、最相关人士讨论最重要的问题。

  

  In the long run, it saves time by increasing eﬃciency, but it’s important that you do it well. You will need to prioritize what you are going to get in sync about and who you are going to get in sync with because of time constraints. Your highest priority should be the most important issues with the most believable and most relevant parties.

* 大胆些！总有一条最好的道路，你要做的是找到它，鼓起勇气沿着它前进。你所认为的可以实现只是根据目前你已知的做出判断。一旦开始追求目标，你会学到很多，尤其是在和他人探讨的情况下，你从未预想过的道路将会呈现。

  当然，也有一些不可能或近乎不可能的事。例如，如果个子矮但要在一个职业篮球队打中锋，或者 70岁时在 4分钟以内跑 1英里（约合 1. 6千米）。

* Be audacious. There is always a best possible path. Your job is to ﬁnd it and have the courage to follow it. What you think is attainable is just a function of what you know at the moment. Once you start your pursuit you will learn a lot, especially if you triangulate with others; paths you never saw before will emerge.

  Of course there are some impossibilities or near- impossibilities, such as playing center on a professional basketball team if you’re short, or running a four-minute mile at age seventy.

##### 好的文化会让问题和分歧浮出水面，并会妥善解决它们

* 这样能够持续促进他们的进化。

* 桥水的做法是创意择优，通过极度求真和极度透明，努力实现有意义的工作，建立有意义的人际关系。我所说的有意义的工作，是指让人们有激情去投入的事业；有意义的人际关系，是指相互之间能够真心关爱的关系（就像一个大家庭）。我认为这两个方面是相辅相成的，而做到极度求真和极度透明，则会使工作和人际关系都能有更好的发展。

* Doing that sustains their evolution.

* In the case of Bridgewater, we do that by having an idea meritocracy that strives for meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical truth and radical transparency. By meaningful work, I mean work that people are excited to get their heads into, and by meaningful relationships I mean those in which there is genuine caring for each other (like an extended family). I find that these reinforce each other and that being radically truthful and radically transparent with each other makes both the work and the relationships go better.
