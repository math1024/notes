#### 个人

##### 5.5 综合分析现实、理解如何行动的最好工具是逻辑、理性和常识



#### 组织

##### 9.6j 帮助人们更好应对由挖掘缺点而带来的痛苦

* 首先，让他们看到自己的失败，其清晰程度足以推动他们做出改变；其次，告诉他们，如何改变做事方式，或者依靠擅长自己弱项的人
* First let them see their failures so clearly that they are motivated to change them, and then show them how to either change what they are doing or rely on others who are strong where they are weak.

##### 9.7a 如果一个人工作干得不怎么样，要考虑这是由于学习不够，还是能力不足

* 缺乏经验或训练造成的缺点可以被修正，而能力不足却不可以
* A weakness that is due to a lack of experience or training can be fixed, while a weakness that is due to a lack of ability can’t be

##### 9.8a 对人进行判断时，不必达到“没有一丝疑问”的地步

* 追求完美会浪费时间，阻碍进展
* **Perfect understanding isn’t possible**; trying to get to it wastes time and stalls progress

##### 9.8d 要像评估应聘者一样严格评估员工

* frank and ongoing evaluations are so important.

##### 9.9 培训、设护栏或辞退员工，不要修复

* 鉴于价值观和能力很难改变，修复通常是不切实际的
* Since values and abilities are difficult to change, rehabilitation is typically impractical

##### 9.9a 不要让员工尸位素餐

* 与辞退人或重新委派任务相比，把一个人留在不适合的岗位上才更糟糕
* It is much worse to keep someone in a job unsuitable for them than it is to fire or reassign them.

9.9b 准备好"朝你爱的人开枪"

* love the people you shoot
* Doing this is one of those difficult, necessary things. 困难面必要的事情
* it is necessary for the long-term excellence of the company. 长期卓越

9.11 不要降低标准

* **如果一个人无法在一定时间内达到我们在追求卓越、极度求真、极度透明等方面的高标准，那么就必须离开。**
* if a person cannot operate within our requirements of excellence through radical truth and transparency in an acceptable time frame, he or she must leave.

##### 10 像操作一部机器那样进行管理以实现目标

* 无论你做什么工作，从更高层次的角度看，你就是在设定目标，并建造机器来实现目标
* No matter what work you do, at a high level you are simply setting goals and building machines to help you achieve them
* 不管你设计得有多好，你的机器总会出问题
* No matter how good you are at design, your machine will have problems.

##### 10.1a 不断把结果和你的目标进行对照

* 所有产出都会反映出机器运转情况
* **as all outcomes are reﬂections of how the machine is running**

##### 10.1c 制定量化评价工具

* 量化工具是进行评价的客观途径，并对提高生产率往往有良好功效
* Metrics are an objective means of assessment and they tend to have a favorable impact on productivity
* 制定量化工具时，要考虑到你为了解事物进展而需要回答的最重要的问题，并设想哪些数据可以提供答案。不要将你已有的数据按你的意图去粉饰
* In constructing your metrics, imagine the most important questions you need answered in order to know how things are going and imagine what numbers will give you the answers to them. Don’t look at the numbers that you have and try to adapt them to your purposes
* 要记住，任何一个量化工具都可能给出误导的信息
* Remember that any single metric can mislead; you need enough evidence to establish patterns.

##### 10.1d 要注意别把精力过多用于应付眼前的各种事务，而忽视你的机器

* If you keep your focus on each individual task, you will inevitably get bogged down. If instead you **pay attention to building and managing your machines**, you will be rewarded many times over
* 如果只把注意力放在完成每个单项任务上，你就会不可避免地深陷其中。如果你能**把注意力放在建造和管理机器上**，就会不断有所回报



#### 每日原则 

* 可能会重复

#####  找出一个问题之后不要容忍问题

* Tolerating a problem has the same consequences as failing to identify it
*  You need to develop a ﬁerce intolerance of badness of any kind, regardless of its severity
* 找到问题的真正原因

##### 做一个超级现实的人

* The pursuit of dreams is what gives life its ﬂavor. 
* My point is that people who create great things aren’t idle dreamers: They are totally grounded in reality. Being hyperrealistic will help you choose your dreams wisely and then achieve them.
